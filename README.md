# hello-world
My first task on github, O God of my father Prophet T.B. Joshua please grant me the Grace to become a professional sotfware developer for your Glory in Jesus Christ Name and by The Power of HolyGhost. Amen
Eko Mokosso is my name; I am passionate about computer science but each time I think about writing codes, I feel intimidated but I'm always willing to learn no matter the challenges. I will be grateful to have someone in the github community to mentor me throughout the process in becoming a better software developer.
